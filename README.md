# Fraud Detection Project - Adey Innovations Inc.

This project aims to develop robust and interpretable fraud detection models for two different datasets:
1. E-commerce transaction fraud (`Fraud_Data.csv`)
2. Credit card transaction fraud (`creditcard.csv`)

## 🧠 Objective

To detect fraudulent activities using machine learning, while handling class imbalance, extracting key features (including geolocation), and applying model explainability techniques.

## 🔧 Key Tasks

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature engineering (time-based, IP geolocation, etc.)
- Handling class imbalance (e.g. SMOTE)
- Model training:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest or XGBoost
- Model explainability using SHAP

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- F1 Score
- AUC-PR (Precision-Recall)
- Confusion Matrix

## 📌 Deliverables

- 📈 SHAP interpretation plots
- 📓 Report summarizing data insights, models, and evaluation
- ✅ GitHub repo with organized code and reproducibility
